# Feed Reader Testing Project
In this repository you will find my solution to the Feed Reader Testing project from Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. This project explores basic concepts regarding Javascript, TDD(Test driven development) and Ajax fetch requests by developing tests(using the Jasmine Javascript library - https://jasmine.github.io/) for an app that fetches an existing RSS feed.

### How to run the application?
1. Download the folder (through ```git clone https://github.com/naorpeled/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git``` or by downloading the zip file through the reposity on *Github*).
2. Open ```index.html```.

### Where can I see the tests?
The tests are located on the bottom of the page.
If a test wasn't passed an error is displayed.
